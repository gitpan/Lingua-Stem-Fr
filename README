Lingua-Stem-Fr version 0.01
===========================

This module is an implementation of the Porter Stemming Algorithm :
http://snowball.tartarus.org/french/stemmer.html
with some improvement.

For example, you can stemm words in this way:

** Word **  ->  ** Stemmed word **
abandonnée           abandon
abandonner           abandon
abandonnera          abandon
abondance            abond
abondant             abond
abondante            abond


The code is carefully crafted to work in conjunction with the the
Lingua::Stem module by Benjamin Franz.
This french version is based on the work of Aldo Calpini (Italian Version)
